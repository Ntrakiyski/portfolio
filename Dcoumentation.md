# Application Documentation: Interactive CV/Portfolio

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This application is a single-page interactive CV/portfolio designed to showcase a professional profile. It features dynamic content sections, responsive navigation, and user-friendly interactions like section highlighting and direct email access.

**Core Objectives:**
*   Display resume content clearly and interactively.
*   Provide intuitive navigation for users to explore sections.
*   Offer clear calls to action (e.g., email, LinkedIn).
*   Maintain a clean, modern, and performant user experience.

## 2. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend Framework:** React (with functional components and Hooks)
*   **Language:** TypeScript (for type safety and improved developer experience)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development)
*   **Animations:** GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and its `ScrollToPlugin` (for smooth scrolling).
*   **Icons:** React Icons (`react-icons/fa`, `react-icons/fi`, `react-icons/io`, `react-icons/io5`)
*   **Build Tool:** Create React App / Vite (implied by file structure)

## 3. Core Concepts & Design Principles

The application adheres to the following principles to ensure maintainability, scalability, and predictable behavior:

*   **Unidirectional Data Flow:** State is primarily managed at a high level (inferred `App.tsx` or similar root component) and passed down to child components via props. Updates flow back up via callback functions passed from parent to child.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI is broken down into small, reusable, and focused components, each responsible for a specific part of the UI or functionality.
*   **Separation of Concerns:**
    *   **Logic Abstraction:** Complex or reusable logic is encapsulated in custom React Hooks (`useSectionObserver`, `useSectionHighlight`).
    *   **UI Rendering:** Components (`MainContent`, `Content`, `Sidebar`, `SectionDivider`) focus solely on presenting data and managing user interactions.
    *   **Data Management:** Static content (`content.json`) and configuration (`navItems.ts`) are externalized from components.
*   **Reactive UI:** The UI dynamically updates based on user interaction (e.g., sidebar toggle) or scroll position (e.g., active navigation link highlighting). `IntersectionObserver` is central to this.
*   **Accessibility (A11y) Considerations:** Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes (`role`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-label`), and keyboard navigation (`tabIndex`, `onKeyDown`) are implemented to improve usability for all users.

## 4. State Management & Data Flow Detailed

The application's core interactivity relies on a centralized state management approach, primarily managed within `App.tsx` (the orchestration layer).

**Key Global States (Managed at Root Level in `App.tsx`):**

*   **`activeSection: string`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Identifies the currently visible content section. Used for:
        *   Highlighting the corresponding navigation item in `SidebarNavAndActions`.
        *   Determining scroll direction in `MobileSectionNavigator`.
    *   **Source:** Updated by `useSectionObserver` (via `setActiveSection` callback).
    *   **Flow:** Passed down as a prop to `MainContent`, `Sidebar`, and `MobileSectionNavigator`.
*   **`sidebarIsOpen: boolean`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Controls the expanded/collapsed state of the main navigation sidebar.
    *   **Source:** Toggled by user interaction within `SidebarShell` or via keyboard shortcuts in `Sidebar`.
    *   **Flow:** Passed down as a prop to `SidebarShell` (for UI), `Sidebar` (for internal logic), and `MobileSectionNavigator` (for hiding mobile controls when sidebar is open).
*   **`highlightTarget: string | null`**:
    *   **Purpose:** A temporary state that signals which content section should receive a visual highlight animation.
    *   **Source:** Set by navigation clicks (via `scrollToSection` in `App.tsx`). Cleared automatically by `useSectionHighlight`.
    *   **Flow:** Passed down as a prop to `MainContent`.

**Centralized Functions & Initializations in `App.tsx`:**

*   **`scrollToSection(href: string)`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Handles smooth scrolling to a specified section ID using GSAP's `ScrollToPlugin`.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Orchestrates the scroll animation and triggers the `highlightTarget` state update upon completion.
    *   **Flow:** Passed down to `Sidebar` and `MobileSectionNavigator`.
*   **GSAP `ScrollToPlugin` Registration:** Registered once on component mount to enable smooth scrolling functionality.

**Key Global States (Managed within `Sidebar.tsx`):**

*   **`isModalOpen: boolean`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Controls the visibility of the `EmailModal`.
    *   **Source:** Toggled by a button in `SidebarNavAndActions` and by closing the modal itself.
    *   **Flow:** Managed within `Sidebar` and passed to `EmailModal`.

**Data Flow Principles:**

*   **Top-Down Data Flow (Props):**
    *   `App.tsx` -> `MainContent` (activeSection, highlightTarget, setHighlightTarget)
    *   `App.tsx` -> `Sidebar` (activeSection, setActiveSection, sidebarIsOpen, setSidebarIsOpen, scrollToSection)
    *   `App.tsx` -> `MobileSectionNavigator` (activeSection, navItems, scrollToSection, isSidebarOpen)
    *   `MainContent` -> `Content` (sectionRefs, visualHighlightedSection)
    *   `Sidebar` -> `SidebarShell` (sidebarIsOpen, setSidebarIsOpen)
    *   `Sidebar` -> `SidebarNavAndActions` (activeSection, handleNavClick, setIsModalOpen)
    *   `Sidebar` -> `EmailModal` (isOpen, onClose)
*   **Bottom-Up Communication (Callbacks):**
    *   `useSectionObserver` calls `setActiveSection` (provided by `MainContent`, ultimately updating root state).
    *   `SidebarShell` calls `setSidebarIsOpen` (updating root state).
    *   `SidebarNavAndActions` calls `handleNavClick` (which calls `scrollToSection`, updating `highlightTarget`) and `setIsModalOpen`.
    *   `EmailModal` calls `onClose`.
    *   `useSectionHighlight` calls `setHighlightTarget` (to clear itself).

## 5. Components & Their Responsibilities

*   **`src/components/MainContent.tsx`**:
    *   **Role:** Container for the main CV content sections.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Initializes `useRef` for each section, orchestrates `useSectionObserver` and `useSectionHighlight`, and delegates rendering to `Content.jsx`.
    *   **Key Props:** `setActiveSection`, `highlightTarget`, `setHighlightTarget`.
*   **`src/components/Content.jsx`**:
    *   **Role:** Renders all dynamic CV content sections.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Reads data from `content.json`, maps data to reusable sub-components (`Job`, `Skill`, `ContactBadges`, `ExperienceTabs`), and applies highlight styling based on `visualHighlightedSection`. Links section `ref` objects for observation.
    *   **Key Props:** `sectionRefs`, `visualHighlightedSection`.
    *   **Internal Components:** `Job` (now integrates `ExperienceTabs`), `Skill`, `ContactBadges`, `SectionWrapper` (for consistent section structure and highlighting).
*   **`src/components/SectionWrapper.tsx`**:
    *   **Role:** Wraps sections with scroll margin and conditional styling for contact section.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Provides consistent section structure and applies visual highlighting. Padding was adjusted from p-5 to p-6 for consistent UI spacing.
*   **`src/components/SectionDivider.tsx`**:
    *   **Role:** Provides consistent vertical spacing between content sections.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Renders a styled horizontal rule with responsive vertical margins (`my-4` for mobile and `lg:my-16` for desktop).
*   **`src/components/ExperienceTabs.tsx`**:
    *   **Role:** Displays detailed job experience information using a tabbed interface.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Renders job title, company, dates, and a challenge description. Manages active tab state. Uses GSAP for smooth content transitions between tabs. Implements responsive tab display, including an overflow menu for smaller screens. Supports touch-based swiping for tab navigation. Displays different content based on the active tab: summarized points, detailed points, associated tools, skills, and projects.
    *   **Key Props:** `points`, `summarizedPoints`, `jobTitle`, `company`, `dates`, `challenge`, `skills`, `tools`, `projects`.
    *   **Internal Logic:** Uses `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `gsap` for animations, and `ResizeObserver` for responsive tab rendering.
*   **`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`**:
    *   **Role:** Central logic orchestrator for the entire sidebar, navigation, and associated actions.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Manages the `EmailModal` state, implements keyboard shortcuts for navigation and sidebar toggling, and passes necessary props/callbacks to its children.
    *   **Key Props:** `activeSection`, `setActiveSection`, `sidebarIsOpen`, `setSidebarIsOpen`, `scrollToSection`.
*   **`src/components/SidebarShell.tsx`**:
    *   **Role:** Provides the structural and animated wrapper for the sidebar content.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Handles the visual expansion/collapse of the sidebar based on `sidebarIsOpen`. Contains the "Navigation" title and toggle icon.
    *   **Key Props:** `sidebarIsOpen`, `setSidebarIsOpen`, `children`.
*   **`src/components/SidebarNavAndActions.tsx`**:
    *   **Role:** Renders the interactive elements within the sidebar.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Displays navigation links (`navItems.ts`), handles navigation clicks, and provides action buttons (Email, LinkedIn, Download).
    *   **Key Props:** `activeSection`, `handleNavClick`, `setIsModalOpen`.
*   **`src/components/EmailModal.tsx`**:
    *   **Role:** Provides a modal dialog for email client selection.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Displays links to compose emails in Gmail and Outlook.
    *   **Key Props:** `isOpen`, `onClose`.
*   **`src/components/MobileSectionNavigator.tsx`**:
    *   **Role:** Provides mobile-specific scroll navigation buttons.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Determines which section to scroll to (next/previous) based on `activeSection` and `navItems`, and hides itself when the main sidebar is open.
    *   **Key Props:** `activeSection`, `navItems`, `scrollToSection`, `isSidebarOpen`.

## 6. Custom Hooks & Their Functionality

*   **`src/hooks/useSectionObserver.ts`**:
    *   **Functionality:** Uses the `IntersectionObserver` API to detect when content sections enter/exit the viewport.
    *   **Purpose:** Updates the `activeSection` state, driving navigation highlighting and mobile scroll controls.
    *   **Inputs:** `sectionRefs` (references to DOM elements), `setActiveSection` (callback).
*   **`src/hooks/useSectionHighlight.ts`**:
    *   **Functionality:** Manages a temporary visual highlight animation for a specific content section.
    *   **Purpose:** Provides immediate visual feedback to the user when navigating to a section (e.g., via sidebar click or keyboard shortcut).
    *   **Inputs:** `highlightTarget` (section ID to highlight), `setHighlightTarget` (callback to clear the target).
    *   **Output:** `visualHighlightedSection` (the section ID currently highlighted for rendering).

## 7. Data & Configuration Files

*   **`src/data/content.json`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Stores all static textual and structural content for the CV sections (intro, bio, experience, skills, contact).
    *   **Implication for AI:** Any content changes or additions should primarily be made here. New sections would require adding data here and then extending `Content.jsx` to render them.
*   **`src/constants/navItems.ts`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Defines the navigation menu items, including their display names, hrefs (corresponding to section IDs), and keyboard shortcuts.
    *   **Implication for AI:** New sections will require an entry here to be navigable via the sidebar and keyboard shortcuts.

## 8. Styling Methodology

*   **Tailwind CSS:** All styling is managed via Tailwind utility classes directly in the JSX.
*   **Animations:**
    *   **CSS Keyframes:** Custom keyframe animations (e.g., `animate-section-highlight`) are defined in the main CSS (inferred from usage) and applied via Tailwind classes.
    *   **GSAP:** Used specifically for smooth scrolling animations (`scrollToSection` function, which implies `gsap.to` with `ScrollToPlugin`). This is imported globally in `Sidebar.tsx`.

## 9. External Library Usage

*   **`react-icons`**: Provides a vast library of SVG icons. Icons are imported per component (`FaLinkedin`, `IoMdMail`, etc.).
*   **`gsap` & `ScrollToPlugin`**: Used for smooth, programmatic scrolling to specific sections. This is critical for the `scrollToSection` functionality.

## 10. Future Enhancements & AI Guidelines

### Known Limitations / Areas for Improvement:

*   **Download CV:** The "Download CV" button is currently disabled (`opacity-50`, `cursor-not-allowed`). Implementing PDF generation or linking to a static PDF would be a valuable feature.
*   **Responsiveness:** While basic Tailwind is used, specific fine-tuning for various mobile and tablet breakpoints could enhance the experience.
*   **Animations:** More subtle GSAP animations could be integrated for elements entering/exiting the viewport (beyond the section highlight).
*   **Content Management:** For very large CVs, a more dynamic content loading strategy might be considered, though for a single-page app, `content.json` is efficient.

### Guidelines for AI Agent Development:

1.  **Prioritize Type Safety (TypeScript):** Always use explicit types and interfaces. When extending components or hooks, define clear `interface Props` or `interface Options`.
2.  **Adhere to Unidirectional Data Flow:** When adding new features that require shared state, ensure the state lives at the lowest common ancestor and is passed down via props, with updates flowing up via callbacks. Avoid direct DOM manipulation unless absolutely necessary (and justified, e.g., `IntersectionObserver` setup).
3.  **Encapsulate Logic in Hooks:** If a piece of logic is reusable, stateful, or involves side effects (like API calls, event listeners, timers), create a custom hook (`useMyFeatureLogic.ts`).
4.  **Keep Components Pure & Focused:** Components should primarily concern themselves with rendering UI based on props and managing their own simple, local UI state. Avoid complex business logic within components.
5.  **Use Tailwind CSS for Styling:** Prefer Tailwind utility classes. For custom animations, define them as CSS keyframes and apply via Tailwind's `animate-` classes.
6.  **Extend `content.json` for New Content:** For any new textual sections, add structured data to `content.json` first, then adapt `Content.jsx` to render it.
7.  **Update `navItems.ts` for New Navigable Sections:** If a new content section needs to be accessible via navigation or keyboard shortcuts, add an entry to `navItems.ts`.
8.  **Leverage Existing Patterns:** Before building new functionality, review existing components and hooks to see if current patterns (e.g., `SectionWrapper`, `Job`, `Skill` components, `useRef` for DOM elements) can be extended or reused.
9.  **Consider Accessibility:** When adding new interactive elements, always include appropriate ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML.
10. **Test Changes:** While a formal testing suite isn't provided, mentally or functionally test changes to ensure they don't break existing features and integrate seamlessly.
