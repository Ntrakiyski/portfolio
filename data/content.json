      "paragraph": "I'm obsessed with solving problems by building things - not just managing them. I get energized when someone shows me a manual process that takes 3 hours and I can automate it in 30 minutes using AI and low-code tools, or when I can turn a struggling product around because I understand both what users actually need and how to build it technically. I'm the rare person who can speak fluent CEO, translate it into developer language, and then build the solution myself - which means faster decisions, shorter feedback loops, and products that actually solve the right problems."

I spent 5 years deliberately learning both because I kept seeing projects fail at the translation layer. I can sit in a meeting where the CEO talks about 'revolutionizing customer experience' and walk out with a technical specification that developers can actually build. Proof: I've inherited 3 different 'stuck' projects and delivered results within 2 months each time by fixing the communication gap, not the technical problems."

I map out manual processes, identify the repetitive parts, and build automated workflows using N8N, APIs, and AI that handle the boring stuff so humans can focus on creative problem-solving. Real example: I built an automated system that eliminated 80% of manual data entry across Gmail, Salesforce, and Instagram by understanding exactly what data moves where and why."

When I tell developers something will take 2 weeks, they believe me because I've built similar features. When I promise clients a feature, I know exactly what's involved. I can prototype solutions in days instead of months, which means faster validation and iteration cycles."

        "I test 2-3 new applications every day - not as a hobby, but as research. I approach each one with two minds: the curious user trying to understand the experience, and the developer reverse-engineering how it was built. This constant learning keeps me ahead of trends and gives me a massive toolkit of solutions I can adapt to new problems.",
        "I refuse to be \"just\" a product manager or \"just\" a developer because the biggest value I bring is connecting different worlds. Companies hire specialists and then struggle to get them to work together effectively. I am the bridge - I can code the solution, manage the team building it, and explain to executives why it matters."
